**DevOps CI/CD Pipeline Automation**

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins to automate the build and deployment of a Java-based application to a Tomcat server.

The project is designed to reflect real-world DevOps practices, focusing on automation, reliability, and repeatable software delivery.
Architecture

**The CI/CD pipeline follows the architecture shown below:**

Git Server → GitHub → Jenkins Server → Tomcat Server

**Tools and Technologies**
Tool	Description

Git Server	Source code version control

GitHub	Centralized repository management

Jenkins	CI/CD automation server

Java	Application development

Maven	Build and dependency management

Docker	Application containerization

Tomcat	Application server

Jenkins Plugins	Git, Maven Integration, Publish Over SSH, Deploy to Container 

CI/CD Workflow

Source Code Management

Application source code is maintained in a Git repository.

Code changes are pushed to GitHub for version control and collaboration.

Continuous Integration

Jenkins monitors the GitHub repository.

**On source code changes:**

Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub.

Maven executes the build lifecycle.

A WAR file is generated as the build artifact.

Continuous Deployment

Jenkins deploys the WAR artifact to a containerized environment.

Deployment is performed securely using SSH.

The application is deployed and started on the Tomcat server.

Jenkins Configuration

**Jenkins job configured with:**

Git SCM integration

Maven build configuration

Docker-based deployment steps

SSH-based remote publishing

**Jenkins plugins used:**

Git Plugin

Maven Integration Plugin

Publish Over SSH Plugin

Deploy to Container Plugin

Build and Deployment Artifacts

WAR artifact generated by Maven

Docker container hosting the application

Jenkins build and deployment logs

**Key Features**
